- Generate initialization tableau and support 2-phases simplex algorithm.
- Implement a full fledged program that solves LP problems (CLI using command line arguments).
- Make the program polymorphic in the variables type, so that it works with Rational and Real numbers.
- Implement the revised simplex algorithm to exploit sparsity.
- Output tableau in MathML.
- Output the feasible region and the path toward optimum (in 2 dimensions).
- Make a graphical user interface.
